## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository or download the files
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-player.git
```

### 2. Add your audio and thumbnail files
- Place `.mp3` files in the `audio/` folder.
- Place corresponding `.png` (or `.jpg`) thumbnails in the `photo/` folder.

### 3. Update the track list
Inside `index.html`, locate this section in the `<script>` tag:
```javascript
let music = [
    { "src": "./audio/0.mp3", "info": "Marwan Pablo - BONO", "thumbnail": "./photo/0.png" },
    { "src": "./audio/1.mp3", "info": "Marwan Pablo - LELLEY YAH", "thumbnail": "./photo/1.png" },
    { "src": "./audio/2.mp3", "info": "Wegz - El WA3D", "thumbnail": "./photo/2.png" },
    { "src": "./audio/3.mp3", "info": "Abyusif - SWLGN", "thumbnail": "./photo/3.png" }
];
```
Change the file paths and titles to match your songs.

### 4. Open in browser
Simply open `index.html` in your preferred browser â€” no server required.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

### Change the Theme
- Modify the gradient background in the CSS section:
```css
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e1e2f, #2a2a4a);
}
```

### Adjust Fade Animation
- Change the fade duration for thumbnail transitions:
```css
#thumbnail {
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Add More Tracks
- Extend the `music` array in `index.html` with additional track objects.

## ðŸ§© How It Works

- **LocalStorage**
  - Saves the last played track index (`current`) and volume level (`volume`).
  - Restores them when the page reloads.

- **Progress Tracking**
  - `ontimeupdate` updates the progress bar and time display.
  - Clicking/dragging the range input seeks to the chosen position.

- **Thumbnail Transitions**
  - CSS class `fade` is toggled to smoothly animate image changes.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling & animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity
- **Font Awesome 6** for control icons
